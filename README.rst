Slides
======

These are the slides I've done for different presentations on different
occasions. I've done them using landslide. If you want to compile them
yourself, you'll need to get landslide::

    $ pip install landslide

And then go to the presentation directory and run::

    $ landslide config.ini

If you need a theme, then that's this one: https://github.com/ametaireau/landslide-theme
